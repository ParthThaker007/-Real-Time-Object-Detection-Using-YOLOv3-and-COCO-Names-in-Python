# -Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv3-and-COCO-Names-in-Python
The aim of this project is to develop a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm and COCO (Common Objects in Context) names dataset. The system will be able to detect and identify various objects in a live video stream or recorded video file, providing accurate and efficient results.
