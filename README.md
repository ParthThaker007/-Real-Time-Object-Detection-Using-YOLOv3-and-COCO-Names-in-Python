# -Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv3-and-COCO-Names-in-Python
The aim of this project is to develop a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm and COCO (Common Objects in Context) names dataset. The system will be able to detect and identify various objects in a live video stream or recorded video file, providing accurate and efficient results.

#Project Overview:
The project will involve the following key steps:
a. Gathering and Preparing Dataset: Acquiring the COCO dataset, which consists of labeled images, and extracting the object names and their corresponding bounding box coordinates.
b. Training YOLOv3: Utilizing the COCO dataset to train the YOLOv3 object detection model. This step involves configuring the network architecture, defining hyperparameters, and performing training iterations.
c. Object Detection Implementation: Implementing the YOLOv3 model in Python using frameworks such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. This will include setting up the necessary dependencies and libraries.
d. Real-Time Object Detection: Developing code to process live video streams or recorded video files and perform object detection using the trained YOLOv3 model. The detected objects will be labeled with their respective class names and bounding box coordinates in real-time.
e. Performance Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy, precision, and recall of the object detection system through various evaluation metrics. This step will involve comparing the detected objects against ground truth annotations from the COCO dataset.
f. Optimization and Enhancement: Fine-tuning the model and system parameters to improve the performance and efficiency of the object detection system. Exploring techniques such as model compression, hardware acceleration, or advanced algorithms can also be considered.

#Expected Deliverables:
a. Python codebase for the real-time object detection system using YOLOv3 and COCO names.
b. Trained YOLOv3 model weights and configuration files.
c. Evaluation report showcasing the system's performance metrics.
d. Documentation outlining the project methodology, system architecture, and instructions for running and customizing the codebase.
